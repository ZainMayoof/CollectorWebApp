# Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vite

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 and TypeScript in Vite. The template uses Vue 3 `<script setup>` SFCs, check out the [script setup docs](https://v3.vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup.html#sfc-script-setup) to learn more.

Learn more about the recommended Project Setup and IDE Support in the [Vue Docs TypeScript Guide](https://vuejs.org/guide/typescript/overview.html#project-setup).

## Viewing the mock BTL collector page

1. Install dependencies if you have not already: `npm install`.
2. Start the dev server: `npm run dev`.
3. Open the URL printed by Vite (typically http://localhost:5173) and navigate to the route that renders `src/components/BtlCollectorPage.vue`.
   - If your router is not already pointing to it, you can temporarily import and render the component in your main view to verify the mock UI.
4. The page is fully hardcoded for demo purposes—no additional configuration or API setup is required.
